        <p>Terms &amp; Conditions for Purchase of Products</p>
        <p>1. The price to be paid by you for any Products will be as quoted via our Site except in cases of obvious error. We are under no obligation to provide the Product to you at the incorrect (lower) price, even after we have sent you an email, if the pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an incorrect pricing.</p>
        <p>2. Our prices include VAT but exclude delivery costs, which will be added to the total amount due before completion of your order.</p>
        <p>3. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already placed.</p>
        <p>4. Our Site contains a large number of Products and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Products listed on our Site may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our order confirmation procedures, so that where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when emailing you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Site, or we are no longer able to supply a particular Product for some reason, we will contact you by email to advise you and/or to obtain your confirmation that the amended price is acceptable.</p>
        <p>5. Payment for all Products must be by credit, debit card or cash and those accepted by us are those listed on our website on the date when your order is placed.</p>
        <p>6. All credit/debit cardholders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your payment card refuses or for any reason does not, authorise payment to us, whether in advance of or subsequent to a payment, we will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of the Products ordered.</p>
        <p>7. Your order constitutes an offer to us to buy a Product. After placing an order, you will receive an email from us.</p>
        <p>8. If you wish to cancel your order for any reason, you must notify us by 4pm by telephone (020 8974 5444) the 3 days before the order is due to be collected or delivered, if your order is under £50. If your order is over £50, you must notify us by telephone (020 8974 5444) at least 14 days before the order is due to be collected or delivered. A refund will only be made to the same credit card with which your order was placed.</p>
        <p>9. If you wish to add to or change your order, or change the date or time of delivery or collection of your order, then we will accommodate you, subject to kitchen space being available to permit us to make your products, provided that you telephone us by 12.00 noon 3 days before your order is due to be collected or delivered.</p>
        <p>10. Your purchase order cannot be accepted until payment in full for the Products ordered has been received by us at which time a legally binding agreement on the terms set out herein will become effective.</p>
